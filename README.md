## HOVALAAG

These are my solutions to [Sean Barret](http://nothings.org)'s [fun little game](http://silverspaceship.com/hovalaag)

### Running on linux

If you happen to have nix, I've packaged a wine wrapper for hovalaag so you should be able to:

```sh
nix run github:p1n3appl3/config#hovalaag
```

### Leaderboards

If you want to compare scores, here are some `stbid`'s for you:

- `stbid:JU4y1gwd:` (me)
- `stbid:6Q5TXsEd:` (also me?)
- `stbid:atRJhYZs:` (rahul)
- `stbid:ncGqi7cD:` (also rahul?? idk why we made multiple)

Also here are some people who were really good at it at the time:

```
<rahul>, [10/2/20 3:51â€¯PM]
the mild satisfaction I felt after getting decent numbers for p3 and p4?

unwarranted

turns out I'm actually undeniably, criminally inadequate

here, add these people if you want to see:
  stbid:bTKDA6fK:   rygorous
  stbid:uMaDWrFO:   Mike Bell
  stbid:S0UbqE1I:   Chris Lentini
  stbid:os2BtDRu:   Zach Wegner
  stbid:5mhevEIB:   yupferris
  stbid:BDVS4waX:   Jeremy Sawicki

gonna go sit in a corner
```

(what a drama queen :P)
